# A Step-by-Step Guide on Using the Abelian Desktop Wallet

Version 0.2.0  
@2023 Abelian Foundation

Abelian is a quantum-resistant Blockchain project. Its native token, ABEL, is a privacy-preserving coin, which empowers users to send and receive ABELs anonymously and untraceably. Abelian uses lattice-based linkable ring signature, lattice-based commitment schemes, and lattice-based zero-knowledge proof systems to achieve security, quantum resistance, and untraceability. Abelian’s vision is to build a quantum-resistant Blockchain ecosystem supporting smart contracts and enhance other Blockchain networks through post-quantum cryptographic bridging technologies.

The Abelian Foundation has developed a desktop version of the Abelian wallet. With an easy-to-use graphical interface, users can create an ABEL wallet account, export the 24-word wallet recovery phrase, import an existing ABEL wallet account, send or receive ABEL tokens, and manage multiple ABEL wallets within a single Abelian Desktop Wallet.

This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial for installing, configuring, and using the Abelian Desktop Wallet.
