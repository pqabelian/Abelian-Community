# Abelian Desktop Wallet Pro User Manual

## Introduction

This document is designed to provide IT professionals and advanced users with comprehensive steps for successfully installing and configuring the Abelian Desktop Wallet Pro, offering you unprecedented control over your transaction privacy and security.

**Multi-Layer Privacy:** it supports two innovative wallet address types:

- **Fully-Private Address**: Thisfeature ensures your transactions are untraceable and your wallet balances remain confidential, providing maximum security and anonymity.

- **Pseudonymous Address**: Similar to Bitcoin's privacy model, this option allows for publicly visible coin values and traceable transactions but benefits from lower gas fees and increased transaction speeds.


**Key Features**:


- **Flexible Privacy Levels**: Choose between Fully-Private and Pseudonymous wallet addresses based on your privacy needs.

- **Seamless Transfers**: Transfer ABELs between Fully-Private and Pseudonymous Wallets effortlessly.

- **Efficient and Stable Chain Access**: By using the Super Node access , users do not need to start Abec locally, which eliminates the time required for local blockchain synchronization, enabling efficient use of Abec services.

With *Abelian Desktop Wallet Pro*, enjoy enhanced privacy, faster transactions, lower gas fees, and the flexibility to manage your privacy on your terms.

### Send ABEL

Abelian Desktop Wallet Pro supports multi-layer privacy transactions, allowing users to choose different privacy levels based on their needs. The multi-layer privacy feature is designed to enhance the anonymity and security of transactions. You can select the desired privacy layer when sending ABEL tokens. 

1) **Ensure that both the Abec and Abewallet synchronization services are active.**
![Abec and Abewallet services are active](/desktop-wallet/pro/abec-abewallet-active-services.png)

2) Navigate to the "**SEND**"① tab, click "**PASTE FROM CLIPBOARD**"② or "**IMPORT FROM FILE**"③ to input the recipient’s wallet address
![Enter the recipient's wallet address](/desktop-wallet/pro/input-receiver-address.png)

- If a **short address**② is pasted from clipboard or imported, it will automatically be recognized and resolved into a **long address**③. A message "**Successfully get the full address.**"① will appear when the resolution is successful (In the Desktop wallet Pro version, the number of characters in the long address of the pseudonymous address is less than that of the fully private address.)
![Resolve short address to long address](/desktop-wallet/pro/short-address-to-full-address.png)

3) Enter the transfer **amount**① and your **master password**②, and then click on the "**SEND**"③ button to confirm the transaction

### Receive ABEL

Navigate to the "**RECEIVE**" tab. If there is no wallet address instance, create one:

  ![Create a wallet address](/desktop-wallet/pro/create-wallet-address.png)<br>
 (The pseudonymous address has a lower privacy level compared to the full-privacy address, but the transaction speed is faster. The full-privacy address prioritizes privacy and security, but processing is slower.)
  2) For example, to create a pseudonymous address, wait for the wallet address instance to be generated. Once the message "**Create an address pseudonymous in this account.**" appears, click the "**Close**" button
  ![Close wallet address creation](/desktop-wallet/pro/close-create-address.png)<br>
